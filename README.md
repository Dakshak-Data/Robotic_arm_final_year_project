# Robotic_arm_final_year_project
ðŸ¤– Industrial Technology 4.0 Based Robotic Arm
ðŸ“… Duration: July 2024 â€“ Present
Affiliated with: Savitribai Phule Pune University

ðŸ”§ Project Overview
This project features a smart robotic arm designed for Industry 4.0 applications. The arm can be controlled through hand gestures and voice commands, making it suitable for both industrial automation and smart home systems.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
Gesture Control: Uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and interpret hand gestures.

Voice Control: Integrates SpeechRecognition to allow natural voice commands.

Real-Time Processing: Commands are processed using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for better contextual understanding.

IoT Integration: Signals are transmitted to the ESP32 microcontroller to control the robotic arm in real-time.

Safety Mechanisms: Includes reset and failsafe functions to ensure secure and stable operation.
